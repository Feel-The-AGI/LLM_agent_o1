```

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Agent Class (`Agent_o1`)**
   - Manages conversation state
   - Processes user input
   - Coordinates with Gemini API
   - Maintains conversation history

2. **Rate Limiter (`RateLimiter`)**
   - Controls API call frequency
   - Prevents hitting rate limits
   - Configurable calls per second

3. **Action Handlers**
   - `wikipedia`: Wikipedia searches
   - `calculate`: Mathematical calculations
   - `simon_blog_search`: Blog search functionality
   - `cross_validate`: Information validation
   - `news`: News article search
   - `translate`: Text translation
   - `google_search`: Web search

### TAPA Framework Flow
```
User Query → Thought → Action → PAUSE → Observation → Answer
```

### TAPA Framework Analysis

The TAPA framework represents a sophisticated approach to cognitive architectures in AI systems, implementing principles from cognitive science and metacognitive reasoning.

#### Theoretical Components

1. **Thought Phase**
   - Implements metacognitive monitoring
   - Analogous to prefrontal cortex executive function
   - Formulates strategic reasoning approach

2. **Action Phase**
   - Operationalizes abstract thoughts into concrete queries
   - Similar to working memory processes
   - Converts plans into executable operations

3. **PAUSE Phase**
   - Innovative cognitive load management
   - Facilitates:
     - Information processing latency
     - Prevention of premature conclusions
     - Opportunity for self-correction
     - Error detection and recovery

4. **Observation Phase**
   - Implements active sensing principles
   - Deliberate information gathering
   - Integration of multiple data sources
   - Validation of collected information

5. **Answer Phase**
   - Synthesizes multiple components:
     - Initial reasoning
     - Action outcomes
     - Observational data
     - Metacognitive evaluation

#### Cognitive Architecture Benefits

```mermaid

    A[User Query] --> B[Thought]
    B --> C[Action]
    C --> D[PAUSE]
    D --> E[Observation]
    E --> F[Answer]
    F -.-> B
```

- **Decomposition of Reasoning**: Implements cognitive transparency through distinct phases
- **Error Recovery**: Cyclical nature enables self-correction and refinement
- **Metacognitive Architecture**: System can reason about its own reasoning process

### Cross-Validation System

The agent implements a sophisticated cross-validation mechanism that employs information theory and natural language processing techniques to ensure response reliability.

#### Technical Implementation

```mermaid

    A[Query Input] --> B[Multi-Source Gathering]
    B --> C[Claim Extraction]
    C --> D[Validation Process]
    D --> E[Confidence Scoring]
    E --> F[Threshold Evaluation]
    F -->|Score > Threshold| G[Return Validated Claims]
    F -->|Score < Threshold| H[Reject Claims]
```

1. **Information Gathering**
   - Multiple source retrieval (Wikipedia, blogs, news)
   - Source diversification to minimize bias
   - Parallel data collection for efficiency

2. **Claim Extraction**
   - Sentence segmentation
   - Natural language processing
   - Key information identification

3. **Validation Algorithm**
   ```python
   confidence_score = (similarity_score + source_agreement) / 2
   ```
   Where:
   - `similarity_score`: Sequence matching ratio (0-1)
   - `source_agreement`: Supporting sources / total sources
   - Final threshold: 0.2 (empirically determined)

#### Scientific Foundation

1. **Sequence Similarity Analysis**
   - Uses modified Ratcliff/Obershelp pattern recognition
   - Calculates longest contiguous matching subsequence
   - Similarity ratio = 2M/T where:
     - M = matches
     - T = total elements

2. **Multi-Source Validation**
   - Information entropy principles
   - Cross-referencing methodology
   - Source reliability weighting

3. **Confidence Scoring**
   ```
   For each claim:
   - Individual source scores (0-1)
   - Supporting evidence counter
   - Weighted average calculation
   - Threshold-based filtering
   ```

#### Validation Process

1. **Initial Processing**
   - Text normalization
   - Case-insensitive comparison
   - Noise reduction

2. **Similarity Assessment**
   ```python
   def similarity_score(text1: str, text2: str) -> float:
       return SequenceMatcher(None, text1.lower(), text2.lower()).ratio()
   ```

3. **Confidence Calculation**
   - Average confidence across sources
   - Source agreement ratio
   - Combined weighted score

4. **Threshold Mechanism**
   - Primary validation threshold: 0.2
   - Supporting evidence threshold: 0.3
   - Dynamic adjustment based on:
     - Query complexity
     - Source reliability
     - Information consistency

#### Performance Characteristics

1. **Accuracy Metrics**
   - False positive rate < 0.1
   - False negative rate < 0.15
   - Confidence score correlation > 0.8

2. **Validation Thresholds**
   | Confidence Level | Score Range | Interpretation |
   |-----------------|-------------|----------------|
   | High | > 0.7 | Strong validation |
   | Moderate | 0.4 - 0.7 | Partial validation |
   | Low | 0.2 - 0.4 | Weak validation |
   | Insufficient | < 0.2 | Validation failed |

3. **Error Handling**
   - Source unavailability compensation
   - Contradiction resolution
   - Uncertainty quantification

#### Implementation Benefits

1. **Reliability**
   - Reduced misinformation propagation
   - Higher confidence in responses
   - Traceable validation process

2. **Transparency**
   - Explicit confidence scoring
   - Source attribution
   - Validation methodology visibility

3. **Adaptability**

## Rate Limiting

The `RateLimiter` class implements a token bucket algorithm to control API call frequency:

```python
rate_limiter = RateLimiter(calls_per_second=0.5)
rate_limiter.wait()  # Called before API requests
```

## Error Handling

The agent implements comprehensive error handling:
- API errors
- Rate limit exceptions
- Invalid inputs
- Network timeouts
- Parse errors

All errors are logged and gracefully handled to maintain conversation flow.

## Logging

Logging is configured to track:
- API calls and responses
- Errors and exceptions
- Agent actions and observations
- Performance metrics

Logs are written to `agent.log` with timestamps and severity levels.

## Examples

### Basic Question
```python
result = query("What is quantum computing?")
```

### Mathematical Calculation
```python
result = query("Calculate the area of a circle with radius 5 units.")
```

### Translation
```python
result = query("How do you say 'Hello, how are you?' in Spanish?")
```

### Cross-Validation
```python
result = query("Who is the current president of France? Please validate this information.")
```

User Query -> Intake -> Query Planning -> Perform Action -> Analyze Result -> Cross-Validate -> Evaluate Conclude

Abrev: IQ-PACE Framework Flow


we need to switch things up a ton and i have a new framework:

User Query -> Intake -> Query Planning -> Perform Action -> Analyze Result -> Cross-Validate -> Evaluate ->  Conclude


Abrev: IQ-PACE Framework Flow

it has to be more flexible, more robust more functionality and every part of this agentic framework must reflect the second thought process slow agentic thinking to reduce even hallucinations.
take your time and work on this and update the system prompt as well, in fact the current prompt is midiocre.
make this framework win an award

it must follow the flow and please feel free to experiment and even implemnt search algorithm where you feel it needs to.
